Credentialed Requests
===

A credentialed request is a request that additionally sends or sets credentials. Credentials refer to any of the following:

* HTTP Authentication ('Authorization' header)
* Client-side SSL (requests that are authenticated where the client accompanies the request with SSL certificate(s))
* Cookies ('Set-Cookie' header)

Credentialed requests will be rejected during pre-flight if `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` has a value of `*` (a wildcard value). The origin must be explicitly set with a hostname or comma delimited hostnames.


FAQ
===

Q. What the hell is `X-Requested-With` and do I need it?
> `X-Requested-With` is a non-standard header that is optionally included in a request to provide identification of origin. jQuery for example sets an `X-Requested-With` header with `$.ajax` requests

Q. How would I avoid a 'pre-flight'?

> Avoid a pre-flight by:

* Not sending a credentialed request
* Not using custom headers (X-Something...), and only using the following headers:
  * Accept
  * Accept-Language
  * Content-Language
  * Last-Event-ID
  * Content-Type
* Only using GET, HEAD, POST

Q. Long-Poll vs. Short-Poll vs. Comet vs. SSE vs. WebSockets vs. PubSub
> Long-Poll: Request connection to be kept open indefinitely for x amount of time before closing and immediately reopening, repeating the pattern. Single direction.

Q. Provisional headers vs. "CAUTION: Provisional headers are shown."
> In the realm of what Chrome displays in the Network tab of your Developer Tools, while requests are pending, headers may appear incorrectly, therefore they are cautioned as provisional, as theyâ€™re subject to change.
>
> In the realm of HTTP status codes, provisional headers are non-permanent headers. They are subject to change and/or removal. The group that manages this is the IANA. All of the `Access-Control-*` headers are deemed provisional.
