Simple XHR Request

```
//
// XMLHttpRequest(null)                    all modern browsers and IE >= 10
// XDomainRequest(null)                    IE 8-9
// ActiveXObject('MSXML2.XMLHTTP.x.0')     IE < 7 (the value of x refers to either version 3 or 6
//
obj = XMLHttpRequest || XDomainRequest || ActiveXObject
xhr = new obj('MSXML2.XMLHTTP.6.0')

Credentialed Requests
===

A credentialed request is a request that additionally sends or sets credentials. Credentials refer to any of the following:

* HTTP Authentication ('Authorization' header)
* Client-side SSL (requests that are authenticated where the client accompanies the request with SSL certificate(s))
* Cookies ('Set-Cookie' header)

Clients that are sending a credentialed request must explicitly set the `#.withCredentials` property on the request object (in the below case, `xhr`) to `true`.

```
obj = XMLHttpRequest || XDomainRequest || ActiveXObject
xhr = new obj('MSXML2.XMLHTTP.6.0')
xhr.withCredentials = true
```

Since credentialed requests from the client trigger a pre-flight, the remote host must respond to the `OPTIONS` request with additional response headers.

Response to the `OPTIONS` request should include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with a value other than `*`, otherwise the pre-flight will be rejected. Values can include a single hostname, or a list of hostnames, delimited by a comma. Additionally, a `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header to ensure that the pre-flight succeeds as the server is saying that credentials being sent to it are a-ok.


FAQ
===

Q. What the hell is `X-Requested-With` and do I need it?
> `X-Requested-With` is a non-standard header that is optionally included in a request to provide identification of origin. jQuery for example sets an `X-Requested-With` header with `$.ajax` requests

Q. How would I avoid a 'pre-flight'?

> Avoid a pre-flight by:

* Not sending a credentialed request
* Not using custom headers (X-Something...), and only using the following headers:
  * Accept
  * Accept-Language
  * Content-Language
  * Last-Event-ID
  * Content-Type
* Only using GET, HEAD, POST

Q. Long-Poll vs. Short-Poll vs. Comet vs. SSE vs. WebSockets vs. PubSub
> Long-Poll: Request connection to be kept open indefinitely for x amount of time before closing and immediately reopening, repeating the pattern. Single direction.

Q. Provisional headers vs. "CAUTION: Provisional headers are shown."
> In the realm of what Chrome displays in the Network tab of your Developer Tools, while requests are pending, headers may appear incorrectly, therefore they are cautioned as provisional, as theyâ€™re subject to change.
>
> In the realm of HTTP status codes, provisional headers are non-permanent headers. They are subject to change and/or removal. The group that manages this is the IANA. All of the `Access-Control-*` headers are deemed provisional.
